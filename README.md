### 🚀 My Projects

* **EvoDoc**: A machine learning-based platform to help doctors provide more personalized and accurate medicines and treatments by analyzing a patient's medical history.
* **RHindCharge**: I developed an IoT prototype to help EV drivers find and book charging spots in real time. It's a small step toward making sustainable transport a little easier.
* **AI News Summary Dashboard**: I built a multilingual news platform using Next.js that gives you real-time articles with AI-generated summaries. It's all about making news consumption more efficient and engaging.
* **Underground Water Leakage Detection System**: This was a fun project where I combined IoT sensors (ESP32 and flow sensors) with a Python-based machine learning model to detect and classify water leaks.
