### 🔧 What I'm Building:

* [cite_start]**AI News Summary Dashboard**: A Next.js application featuring a visually stunning UI with animated elements[cite: 105]. [cite_start]It provides real-time news articles in multiple languages with AI-generated summaries[cite: 20, 106].
* [cite_start]**Real-time EV Charging Port Vacancy System**: An IoT prototype to detect real-time port availability[cite: 24, 116]. [cite_start]It allows users to book time slots for charging[cite: 25, 117].
* [cite_start]**Underground Water Leakage Detection System**: An advanced system combining IoT sensors and machine learning[cite: 94]. [cite_start]It uses ESP32 and flow sensors to collect real-time data and a Python-based ML model to classify leaks[cite: 95, 96].
* [cite_start]**AI N-Queens Problem Solver**: A Python-based solver for the N-Queens problem using backtracking[cite: 29, 89]. [cite_start]It visualizes board states and evaluates solution efficiency across different board sizes[cite: 30, 90].
