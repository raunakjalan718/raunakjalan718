Fun Python Fact
Did you know? 🐍

The name "Python" isn't derived from the snake but from the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, was reading the script for the series during Python's implementation and thought it was a fun and quirky name for the language.
