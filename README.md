# Hi there, I'm Raunak Jalan! 👋  

🚀 **Budding Engineer | IoT & AI Enthusiast | Problem Solver**  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about exploring tech, solving real-world problems, and building innovative solutions. Currently, I’m diving deep into **Python, IoT, AI, and system design**, turning ideas into functional projects.  

## 🔧 What I'm Working On:  
- **Smart Water Leakage Detection System** 💧 *(IoT-powered, ML-enhanced)*  
- **RFID-Based EV Charging Automation** ⚡  
- **Network Bandwidth Prioritization System** 🌐 *(For better control over internet speed distribution)*  
- More cool ideas in the making!  

## 📚 Learning & Exploring:  
- **Python**, Data Structures & Algorithms 🧠  
- **Machine Learning** for smart automation 🤖  
- **IoT & Embedded Systems** (ESP32, Arduino) 🔩  
- **Web Development** (for project dashboards) 🌍  

## 🎯 My Approach:  
I believe in **learning by doing**—from writing scripts that automate tasks to designing AI-driven IoT systems. If it solves a problem, I’m all in!  

## 💡 Fun Fact:  
Python isn’t named after the snake 🐍—it’s inspired by *Monty Python’s Flying Circus*! The creator, Guido van Rossum, just liked the show’s quirky humor.  

## 🤝 Let's Connect!  
I'm always up for **tech discussions, collaborations, and innovative ideas**. Feel free to reach out!
