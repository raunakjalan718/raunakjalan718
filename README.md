### üöÄ My Projects

* **AI News Summary Dashboard**: I built a multilingual news platform using Next.js that gives you real-time articles with AI-generated summaries. It's all about making news consumption more efficient and engaging.
* **Real-time EV Charging Port Vacancy System**: I developed an IoT prototype to help EV drivers find and book charging spots in real time. It's a small step toward making sustainable transport a little easier.
* **Underground Water Leakage Detection System**: This was a fun project where I combined IoT sensors (ESP32 and flow sensors) with a Python-based machine learning model to detect and classify water leaks.
* **AI N-Queens Problem Solver**: I implemented a solver for the classic N-Queens problem using Python. It was a great way to dive into backtracking algorithms and visualize how AI optimization works.
